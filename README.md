My name is Pete.

I help field and scale emerging technologies for national security.

My current interests are quantum computing & networking, applied artificial intelligence, and next-generation cybersecurity solutions.

I work at IonQ Quantum and help align applied projects with U.S. government agencies.

I am also a technical consultant to emerging technology and space companies via my two firms, New Harbor Collective and Villano Ventures.
